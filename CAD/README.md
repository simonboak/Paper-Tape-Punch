# CAD Files

I’m including a STEP file containing the full project design which was used for the machined and printed parts.

~~Some~~ a lot of assembly is required for anyone embarking on this project. Some details are missing from the model, this is really a guide for anyone thining of building something similar. You shouldn't expect to just print these parts and have a working punch.

This project was designed in Plasticity.
